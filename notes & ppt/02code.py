    DESCRIPTION: Let's consider our example 01code.py in which we computed
    the total cost of an ice cream cone.
    Define a function as calculatePrice. Prompt the user to enter the number of
    scoops they want to buy. Continue calculating the total cost of the order
    using the price of each scoop multipled by the number of scoops purchased.
    NOTE: input will store the number as a string. Python will not allow you to
    multiply the string by an int or float. So we first convert a str to an int.
    The price per scoop is $2.50.
